Lord Almighty, I feel my temperature risin', mmm
Higher, higher, it's burning through to my soul
Girl, girl, girl, girl, you're gonna set me on fire
My brain is flamin', I don't know which way to go, yeah
Your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
You light my mornin' sky with burning love, mmm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I feel my temperature risin', mm
Help me, I'm flamin', I must be a 109, mmm
Burnin', burnin', burnin' and nothing can cool me, yeah
I just might turn into smoke, but I feel fine
'Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
And you light my mornin' sky with burning love
It's comin' closer, the flames are now lickin' my body, mm
Won't you help me? I feel like I'm slippin' away
It's hard to breathe, and my chest is a-heavin', mmm, hmm
Lord, have mercy, I'm burning a hole where I lay, yeah
Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky with burning love
With burning love (a hunk, a hunk of burning love, ah)
I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love (ah)
I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love, ah (ah)
A hunk, a hunk of burning love, ah (ah)
A hunk, a hunk of burning love, ah (ah)
A hunk, a hunk of burning love (ah)
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love, ah (ah)
A hunk, a hunk of burning love, ah, ah (ah)
I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
