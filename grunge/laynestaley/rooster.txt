Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere, hmm
Wife and kids household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere, hmm

Here they come to snuff the rooster, yeah
Here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no oh, you know he ain't gonna die

Here they come to snuff the rooster, yeah
Here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die, oh
No, no, no oh, you know he ain't gonna die

Walkin' tall machine gun men
They spit on me in my home land
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy, hmm
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathing his dyin' breath
Oh, God please won't you help me make it through

Here they come to snuff the rooster, oh yeah
Here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no oh, you know he ain't gonna die

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
