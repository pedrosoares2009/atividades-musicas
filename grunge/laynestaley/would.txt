This song is called "Would"
Would
by my master
(Teach thee on child) love hereafter
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
it's sole desertion
(Flying, not yet) quite the notion
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
Am I wrong
Have I run too far to get home?
Have I gone
And left you here alone?
Am I wrong
Have I run too far to get home? Yeah
Have I gone
And left you here alone?
If
I
Would
Could
You?
